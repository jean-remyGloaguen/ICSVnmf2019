	abstract = {This letter presents theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental results about nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence. We describe how IS-NMF is underlaid by a well-defined statistical model of superimposed gaussian components and is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of variance parameters. This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177950},
	abstract = {Methods for detection of overlapping sound events in audio involve matrix factorization approaches, often assigning separated components to event classes. We present a method that bypasses the supervised construction of class models. The method learns the components as a non-negative dictionary in a coupled matrix factorization problem, where the spectral representation and the class activity annotation of the audio signal share the activation matrix. In testing, the dictionaries are used to estimate directly the class activations. For dealing with large amount of training data, two methods are proposed for reducing the size of the dictionary. The methods were tested on a database of real life recordings, and outperformed previous approaches by over 10\%.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a sound event detection system for nat-ural multisource environments, using a sound source separa-tion front-end. The recognizer aims at detecting sound events from various everyday contexts. The audio is preprocessed us-ing non-negative matrix factorization and separated into four individual signals. Each sound event class is represented by a Hidden Markov Model trained using mel frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from the audio. Each separated signal is used individually for feature extraction and then segmentation and classification of sound events using the Viterbi algorithm. The separation allows detection of a maximum of four overlap-ping events. The proposed system shows a significant increase in event detection accuracy compared to a system able to output a single sequence of events.
